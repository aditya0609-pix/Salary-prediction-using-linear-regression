Prediction of  employee's salary in terms of their experience using the data

Simple linear regression is useful for finding relationship between two continuous variables.
One is predictor or independent variable and other is response or dependent variable. 
It looks for statistical relationship but not deterministic relationship. 
Relationship between two variables is said to be deterministic if one variable can be accurately expressed by the other.
For example, using temperature in degree Celsius it is possible to accurately predict Fahrenheit. 
Statistical relationship is not accurate in determining relationship between two variables. For example, relationship between height and weight.
The core idea is to obtain a line that best fits the data. The best fit line is the one for which total prediction error (all data points) are as small as possible. 
Error is the distance between the point to the regression line.
